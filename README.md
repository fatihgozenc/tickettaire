# Tickettaire
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Info
My decision tree can be viewed in `tickettaire.pdf` in project root. I haven't implemented the bicycle, children and subscription tickets. I've spent a lot of time on writing the decision tree, so codebase may look sloppy in some parts because of speed. It needs a lot of refactoration. For example I am managing the tree in App.js but it needs to be Redux store with specific dispatchers. Also I haven't used TypeScript and Jest to speed up. CSS supports mobile and desktop size. I haven't use any UI libraries to show my raw skills.

## Dependencies
I bootstrapped the project with create-react-app on Yarn. You need to run `yarn` in project directory.

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\

### Thank you
I hope you like the project.
